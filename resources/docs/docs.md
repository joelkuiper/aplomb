### Managing Your Middleware

Request middleware functions are located under the `ocpu-balancer.middleware` namespace.
A request logging helper called `log-request` is defined below:

```clojure
(defn log-request [handler]
  (fn [req]
    (timbre/debug req)
    (handler req)))
```

This namespace also defines two vectors for organizing the middleware called `development-middleware` and `production-middleware`.
Any middleware that you only wish to run in development mode, such as `log-request`, should be added to the first vector.
